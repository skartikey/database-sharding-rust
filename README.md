# Rust Sharding CRUD Example

## Overview

This repository contains a Rust example demonstrating sharding logic and CRUD operations across multiple shards using hash-based sharding.

## Setup

### Requirements

- Rust Environment: Ensure you have Rust installed on your system.

### Dependencies

This example doesn’t require external crates for simplicity, but in a real application, you might consider crates like diesel for ORM, tokio for async, and serde for serialization.

## Code Implementation

The core logic for sharding and CRUD operations is implemented in `src/main.rs`. Below is a simplified overview of the key components:

### Shard Structure

Represents a database shard. It’s a simple key-value store for this example.

### ShardedDatabase Structure

Manages multiple shards and distributes data among them based on the hash of the key.

### CRUD Operations

Implemented as methods on ShardedDatabase, which delegate operations to the appropriate shard based on the key.

## Running the Example

Execute your program with Cargo:

```bash
cargo run
```

This will compile and run the Rust application, demonstrating simple CRUD operations across sharded in-memory data stores.

## Extending to a Real Database

To extend this example to work with a real database:

1. **Setup Database Instances**: Each acting as a shard.
2. **Database Connections**: Use a Rust database driver (like diesel for SQL databases) to connect to and interact with each shard.
3. **Error Handling**: Add comprehensive error handling for database operations.
4. **Asynchronous Operations**: Use async/await for non-blocking database IO operations, likely requiring an async runtime like tokio.
